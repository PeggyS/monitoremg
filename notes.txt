sharing of info between apps uses memmapfile
	- magstim_val.data - magstim info sent to emg_activity_mvc_goal 
		- used in updateDisplay.m and run_emg.m
		- 3 bytes
		- magstim value
		- bistim value
		- isi
	- emg_data.data - up to 8 channels of emg data - info for each channel
		- used in setup_memmap.m, run_emg.m, get_emg_data.m
		- new data flag
		- magstim, bistim, and isi
		- goal val, min and max
		- pre-stim emg value
		- muscle name (30 chars)
		- emg data
	- data_channels.data - 
		- number of emg channels
		- flag for if the channel is in the activity monitor figure
		- channel names, up to 8, 30 char each
		- flag to store data or not
		

magspy - reads (spies on) magstim communication between Brainsight and Magstim
	- needs special serial connector with the write pin disconnected ? (from what I recall - this could be wrong)
	- 


datapoint table
	- in emg_rc it's saved in app.rc_axes.Userdata or app.sici_axes.Userdata
	- in review_emg it's in the app.h_uitable

dragging lines in real-time display mep does not have an endfcn, so dragging the lines does not update previous rc or sici datapoint values.

*_emg_dat.txt each row has stim info and emg data before and after the stimulus
	- info listed before the emg data depends on when the file was created
	- before xxx
	- between xxx and yyy
	- after 2022-07-15:
		- Use, magstim_val, bistim_val, isi_ms, effective_so


============================================
magstim, bistim, and simulataneous discharge
--------------------------------------------
After Jan 2019, the single magstim setup was replaced with Bistim setup. Later (around xxx) we started using simultaneous discharge with the Bistim setup to get higher stimulus pulses.

emg_rc - during data collection the recuitment curve shows the main/master/top stimulator value. The values rc fit values are used to compute sici & icf stim levels. When simultaneous discharge was used for the rc, the rc values are converted to values to use with the bistim setup. Spreadsheet stim_bistim.numbers is used to convert.

review_emg_rc - in post analysis, bistim and simultaneous discharge values are converted to effective stimulus output (SO) - the equivalent output of a single stand-alone magstim.

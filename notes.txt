magspy - reads (spies on) magstim communication between Brainsight and Magstim
	- needs special serial connector with the write pin disconnected ? (from what I recall - this could be wrong)

datapoint table
	- in emg_rc it's saved in app.rc_axes.Userdata or app.sici_axes.Userdata
	- in review_emg it's in the app.h_uitable

dragging lines in real-time display mep does not have an endfcn, so dragging the lines does not update previous rc or sici datapoint values.

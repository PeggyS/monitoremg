sharing of info between apps uses memmapfile
	- magstim_val.data - magstim info sent to emg_activity_mvc_goal 
		- used in updateDisplay.m and run_emg.m
		- 3 bytes
		- magstim value
		- bistim value
		- isi
	- emg_data.data - up to 8 channels of emg data - info for each channel
		- used in setup_memmap.m, run_emg.m, get_emg_data.m
		- new data flag
		- magstim, bistim, and isi
		- goal val, min and max
		- pre-stim emg value
		- muscle name (30 chars)
		- emg data
	- data_channels.data - 
		- number of emg channels
		- flag for if the channel is in the activity monitor figure
		- channel names, up to 8, 30 char each
		- flag to store data or not
		

magspy - reads (spies on) magstim communication between Brainsight and Magstim
	- needs special serial connector with the write pin disconnected ? (from what I recall - this could be wrong)
	- 


datapoint table
	- in emg_rc it's saved in app.rc_axes.Userdata or app.sici_axes.Userdata
	- in review_emg it's in the app.h_uitable

dragging lines in real-time display mep does not have an endfcn, so dragging the lines does not update previous rc or sici datapoint values.

*_emg_dat.txt each row has stim info and emg data before and after the stimulus
	- info listed before the emg data depends on when the file was created
	- before 2019-06-01
	- between 2019-06-01 and 2022-07-15
	- after 2022-07-15:
		- Use, magstim_val, bistim_val, isi_ms, effective_so

review_emg_rc - first looks in the analysis hierarchy for *_datapoints.csv. If it's not found there, then it looks in the data hierarchy.
	- rc datapoints are read in and put in rc fig then previous rc_fit_info.txt is looked for and if exists, read in and then info is updated in the figure. display_rc_fit_info_on_axes.m is called from get_previous_rc_or_sici_info.m
	- sici datapoints are read in, as they are added to the figure, the mean and confidence interval lines are computed and updated in the sici figure. If an existing sici_info.txt file is found and read in, then read in values are compared to what is in the sici fig. If the figure mean values are not the same as the ones in the file, then info is sent to the command window and beeps.


============================================
magstim, bistim, and simulataneous discharge
--------------------------------------------
After Jan 2019, the single magstim setup was replaced with Bistim setup. Later (around xxx) we started using simultaneous discharge with the Bistim setup to get higher stimulus pulses.

After 2022-07-17, *_datapoints.csv has 2 header lines. The first line is the new line added. It is a single word, either 'magstim' or 'bistim': the hardware setup used for recording. The 2nd line is the previously existing list of variable names.

emg_rc - during data collection the recuitment curve shows the main/master/top stimulator value. The values rc fit values are used to compute sici & icf stim levels. When simultaneous discharge was used for the rc, the rc values are converted to values to use with the bistim setup. Spreadsheet stim_bistim.numbers is used to convert.

review_emg_rc - in post analysis, bistim and simultaneous discharge values are converted to effective stimulus output (SO) - the equivalent output of a single stand-alone magstim.

sici_info.txt - ts and cs values are the numbers on the bistim setup of stimulators. These are NOT converted to stand-alone magstim values.

=================================
MEP latency and MEP-max amplitude
---------------------------------
2022-12-12: Discussion between S Pundik & P Skelly: decided to use methods from Cerins 2022 to determine active MEP latency. We will extract the MEP latency and the mean MEP-max amplitude of the highest stimulator output recorded for the recruitment curve.
	- ref: Cerins et al, “Assessment of cortical inhibition depends on inter individual differences in the excitatory neural populations activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation”, Nature Scientific Reports, 2022
	- examine each epoch/trial/trace and roughly define MEP window. Only use trials where the EMG spike in the window is consistent with other probable MEPs. If the spike in the window seems like spontaneous activity (often also seen in the pre-stim EMG time period), then exclude that trial from latency calculation.
